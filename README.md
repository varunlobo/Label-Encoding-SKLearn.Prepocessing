Implementation of Label Encoder to convert columns with object datatypes into numeric datatypes.

This is an essential step before we split our datatype into Train vs Test. It prevents us from discarding useful information that could be used to further strengthen our model and accuracy of the model. 

In this notebook I demonstrate the successful conversion of columns with object datatype into int64 datatype.
